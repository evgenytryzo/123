## Difficulties I encountered

- Difficulty with working with format blocks: position: absolute. And their adaptation.
- Interesting, but not easy work with backgrounds in Next.js
- Tightening work with adaptation of Header component.

## Started

- ### First, copy the repository:

```
git clone git@github.com:evgenytryzo/test-task-true-code.git
```

- ### Install dependencies using Yarn:

```
yarn install
```

- ### Then run the command on the command line:

```
docker compose up
```

With this command, you will launch the container with the application.

For installing all dependencies type `yarn`

> If you get some error delete `.node_modules` and try again **or** create an issue about that

- ### Open a browser window and navigate to a local host with port 4000:

```
http://localhost:4000/
```

Open [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) with browser to see the result.
